# Assignment 1
 My first CS648 assignment

## This static webpage assignment has been designed keeping in mind **3 main objectives**:
* To help students get started with the newly setup [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) and [Github Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) frameworks
* To give students some hands-on practice in the spirit of _learning by doing_
* To give students something **_AWESOME_** to play around with
